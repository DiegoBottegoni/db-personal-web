My personal website ‚ú®

I built this site for myself ‚Äî to share a bit about who I am, showcase some of my work, and, above all, because I enjoy creating and learning.  
It's a space that will keep evolving over time.

Feel free to explore, reach out, or send any feedback or advice ‚Äî anything that helps me improve the website, my skills, or the overall user experience is always welcome!

Thanks for stopping by.

‚Äì Diego
